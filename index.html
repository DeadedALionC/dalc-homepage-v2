                    <p class="about-content content">
                        As a team, we put a lot of thought in producing this PFP NFT collection. This collection, which revolves around the King of the Jungle, is largely inspired by the founders’ place of residence, living in the Lion City. Coincidentally, the very first NFT bought by the founders were the CDC's Loaded Lions, hence the Loaded Lion family hold a special place in our hearts; the project, their achievements or the lack thereof all contributed to the vision/mission for the DALC.
                        <br><br>
                        Our art comprises of a humane lion half reminding us on the inherent good-natured and courageous souls which reside within. While in contrast, the "Deaded" aspect of the art aims to portray the uncertainty and devious nature of the NFT/metaverse which are highly unpredictable and can slowly eat away the trust and respect for the field. We aim to close this gap and provide a collection which is authentic, legitimate and most importantly valuable for our holders. And we pride ourselves in deploying these lions to protect and preserve the better half of field, essentially providing a safe space for our holders.

            <h1 class="story-title">DALC'S LORE</h1>
            <p class="story-content">
              The Lion has always been revered as the King of the Jungle, powerful creatures who are a symbol of courage and strength. Ferocious during combat, and steadfast in defence – they are the sword, the shield and most importantly the pride of the jungle who bring value to any community they pledge themselves to.
              <br><br>
              From the prosperous lion city state where technology is boundless, 10,000 individuals volunteered to the call for a venture into the wilderness of the blockchain. Needless to say, these young lions did not know what they were getting into since the “metaverse” was such a mystery to most. Mostly extravagant stories which were fed through the media of previous
              successful expeditions to the edge of the renowned “OpenSea” – which were enticing to most who lived deep in the dense vegetation and urbanization of the real-world. Yet little was heard of any negative side effects for traversing this said “metaverse”. It all sounded too  good to be true, and there was only one way to find out.
              <br><br>
              With a flip of a finger, our young lions adopted their newfound Web3 identity before entering the bleep and into the Metaverse.
              <br><br>
              There were so many like-minded communities, clubs and societies co-existing here; and apes seemed to have dominated the field. Except many turned out to be a hoax as our lions would learn during their time there. It was difficult to trust anyone out here – to differentiate the nonchalant veteran apes from the many bad ape-ples trying to pull off as
              one. It was just such an unusual space – from punks who have found their place in society, to crooks who aren’t all that bad, and where real friends may be those whom you could never really see (eye to eye with). Yet hang around long enough to reveal the true colours of  certain frosted individuals who soon pool to a puddle, bunnies that eventually rot to death,  poor dwarves who remain short (of expectations), and lords who were dirtbags after all.
              <br><br>
              While the potential for growth is in abundance here on the blockchain, the same can be said for the dangers and threats that lurk within. Our young courageous lions would soon find themselves wasting away from the toxic environment hidden in the great Metaverse unbeknownst to most outside of it. The pack suffered a painless degradation over time which they have concluded would soon turn them into dust. These lions could not simply sit around and await their doom, they regrouped and unashamed of their experiences, embraced the lessons learnt that carved onto their very identity in search of their redemption. The 10,000 strong pack would soon move to establish their identity in the Metaverse as the Deaded Anatomy Lion Club (DALC).
              <br><br>
              The Metaverse will never be a safe place to be in, unless we make it to be – which is the  mission of the DALC; to build a safe thriving haven here in the Metaverse.

            Deaded Anatomy Lion Club is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum
            network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to purchase digital collectibles. Users
            are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and
            validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as
            the Deaded Anatomy Lion Club smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to
            undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.
            <br><br>
            This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Deaded Anatomy Lion Club digital collectibles.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <span class="content-header">1. Ownership</span>
            <br><br>
            A. You Own the NFT. Each Deaded Anatomy Lion is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you
            purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Deaded Anatomy Lion, the Art, completely. Ownership of
            the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we
            seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Deaded Anatomy Lion.
            <br><br>
            B. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide,
            royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you
            choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial
            use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Deaded Anatomy Lion /
            NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Deaded Anatomy Lion owner’s
            rights to display the Art for their Deaded Anatomy Lion to ensure that only the actual owner can
            display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion,
            involvement, or participation of your Deaded Anatomy Lion, provided that the website/application
            cryptographically verifies each Deaded Anatomy Lion owner’s rights to display the Art for their
            Deaded Anatomy Lion to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that
            the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Deaded Anatomy Lion leaves the
            website/application.
            <br><br>
            C. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you an
            unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating
            derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would
            e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies
            of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i)
            owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Deaded Anatomy Lion generally,
            provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Deaded Anatomy Lion owner’s rights
            to display the Art for their Deaded Anatomy Lion to ensure that only the actual owner can display
            the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion,
            involvement, or participation of Deaded Anatomy Lions generally, provided that the third party
            website or application cryptographically verifies each Deaded Anatomy Lion owner’s rights to display
            the Art for their Deaded Anatomy Lion to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and
            provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Deaded Anatomy Lion
            leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.
            <br><br>
            D. DALC IP. Other than the rights to the Art, nothing herein gives you any rights to any other
            trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to Deaded Anatomy Lion Club including,
            without limitation, to Deaded Anatomy Lion Club, Deaded Anatomy Lions, DALC, and the associated
            logos. All of these rights are expressly reserved by the founders of Deaded Anatomy Lion Club.
            <br><br>
            E. Feedback. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the
            Site, including without limitation about how to improve the Site (collectively, “Feedback”). By
            submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback in any way we choose
            without additional compensation to you, and you hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable,
            nonexclusive, worldwide license to incorporate and use the Feedback for any purpose.

            <br><br>
            <span class="content-header">2. Your Obligations</span>
            <br><br>
            You are solely responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the Site, and for any
            consequences thereof. You agree to use the Site only for purposes that are legal, proper and in
            accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations. By way of example, and not as
            a limitation, you may not, and may not allow any third party to: (i) send, upload, distribute or

            person; (iv) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Site any content that
            infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any party or otherwise violates the legal
            rights of others; (v) engage in, promote, or encourage illegal activity (including, without limitation,
            money laundering); (vi) interfere with other users' use of the Site; (vii) use the Site for any
            unauthorized commercial purpose; (viii) modify, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of

            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <span class="content-header">3. Fees and Payment</span>
            <br><br>
            A. If you elect to purchase a Deaded Anatomy Lion through the Site, any financial transactions that
            you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no insight into
            or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any
            transactions. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that
            may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct
            via the Ethereum network.
            <br><br>
            B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that
            occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the
            decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each
            transaction.

            <br><br>
            <span class="content-header">4. Disclaimers</span>

            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <span class="content-header">6. Risk Assumption</span>
            <br><br>
            You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
            A. To the extent that you sell your Deaded Anatomy Lion Club NFT, please be aware that the prices
            of NFTs are extremely volatile and fluctuations in the prices of other NFTs and impact the price of
            your Deaded Anatomy Lion Club NFT both positively and negatively. Given the volatility, NFTs such
            as Deaded Anatomy Lion Club should not be considered an investment. You assume all risks in that
            connection.
            <br><br>
            B. Ownership of a Deaded Anatomy Lion Club NFT confers ownership of digital artwork only.
            Accordingly, no information on this Site (or any other documents mentioned therein) is or may be
            considered to be advice or an invitation to enter into an agreement for any investment purpose.
            Further, nothing on this Site qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction
            nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial
            products. Due to the artistic nature of the project, Deaded Anatomy Lion Club has not been
            registered with or approved by any regulator in any jurisdiction. It remains your sole responsibility to
            assure that the purchase of the Deaded Anatomy Lion Club NFT and the associated art is in
            compliance with laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.
            <br><br>
            C. You assume all risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited
            to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software
            introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored
            within your wallet.
            <br><br>
            D. NFTs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are relatively new and the regulatory landscape
            is unsettled. New regulations could negatively impact such technologies impacting the value for your
            Deaded Anatomy Lions. You understand and accept all risk in that regard.
            E. You assume all responsibility for any adverse effects of disruptions or other issues impacting
            Ethereum or the Ethereum platform.
            <br><br>
            F. Depending on the popularity, scope and sales of the Deaded Anatomy Lion Club NFT project, We
            reserve the right to adjust, change or reduce the roadmap displayed on site. Our roadmap, which is
            displayed, includes a part that is named “Post Sell-Out” containing elements that we will execute
            and realize only if the collection sells out. If the collection does not sell out, the execution of these
            elements will be at our sole discretion and may be cancelled or reduced. Our roadmap includes the
            acquisition of a land in the Metaverse. However, please note that we have no share in the
            Metaverse and no control over it. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the user experience and users
            will have to abide by the terms and conditions of the Metaverse. At the moment, the land would be
            in Otherside/ Arcade Metaverse, but this could change depending on several factors, including the
            popularity of projects offering an immersive experience in the Metaverse.
            <br><br>
            G. This project is strictly an NFT art project that could eventually provide utilities for its holders.
            However, we do not guarantee any profitability for the buyers and it is understood that this is not
            the goal or the reason of the project. This project should not be considered as an investment. The
            main goals of this project are to promote art, to have fun and to have utilities for the holders.
            <br><br>
            H. As part of this project, we offer several giveaways. Depending on the popularity, scope and sales
            of the Deaded Anatomy Lion Club NFT project, we reserve the right to reduce or cancel or reduce
            these giveaways. If we draw prices that are physical goods, we reserve the right to pay the
            equivalent of the prize in ETH instead of giving the physical prize.
